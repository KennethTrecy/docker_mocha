# Demo 20221222
This is a demonstration on how to make a testing framework watch files in a container. The testing
framework used in this demo is [Mocha].

Upon looking in the [dependencies] of [Mocha], it uses [Chokidar package] and requires
[`CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING`] to watch the files. This problem was also faced in [other packages].

## Instructions

### Pre-requisites
- [Docker]
- [Node.js and npm]

### Steps
1. Open Docker desktop application or at least start it is able to run a container.
2. While waiting for the desktop application, run `npm install` in case you want run the tests
	locally first.
3. When Docker is ready to run a container, run `docker compose up -d`.
4. Check the desktop application to confirm that the container is running and view its output.
5. Try to change the results in [sample test](./t/sample.js).
6. You should see that the test will re-run in the container.

## Origin
Some parts of the repository was based from [`empty_package_json`] branch of [Web Template].
